# Energy Market Dashboard

The **Energy Market Dashboard** is a full-stack project that simulates and visualizes energy market data using a Flask backend and a React frontend. The backend generates fake energy data for a set of countries, and the frontend displays this data in a responsive bar chart.

## Features

- **Backend (Flask API):**
  - Generates random (simulated) energy data (price and demand) for countries such as Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and Poland.
  - Exposes a RESTful endpoint at `/api/data` to serve this data as JSON.
  - Uses Flask-CORS to allow cross-origin requests.
  - Containerized with Docker and deployed to Fly.io (free tier).

- **Frontend (React App):**
  - Fetches data from the Flask backend using Axios.
  - Visualizes the data using a responsive bar chart powered by Chart.js (via react-chartjs-2).
  - Displays a "Loading data..." message until data is fetched.
  - Deployed to Vercel (free tier).

## What the Project Does


- **Backend:**
  - The Flask backend in `backend/app.py` simulates energy market data by randomly generating values for energy price and demand for a list of countries.
  - It provides this data via a GET request at the `/api/data` endpoint.
  - CORS is enabled so that the frontend can access the backend even if they are hosted on different domains or ports.

- **Frontend:**
  - The React frontend in `frontend/energy-dashboard-frontend` contains a `Dashboard` component.
  - This component uses Axios to fetch the simulated data from the backend.
  - The data is visualized using a bar chart:
    - **X-Axis:** Displays the list of countries.
    - **Y-Axis:** Displays numeric values for energy price and demand.
  - Initially, a "Loading data..." message is shown until the data is fetched.

### Visualization Example

Imagine a bar chart where:
- The **X-Axis** lists countries: Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Poland.
- The **Y-Axis** shows the values.
- For each country, two bars are displayed:
  - One for **Energy Price** (e.g., €45.67)
  - One for **Energy Demand** (e.g., 3500 units)

This gives a clear visual comparison of energy market metrics across different countries.

## Installation and Running Locally

### Prerequisites

- **Git**
- **Python 3.x**
- **Node.js** and **Yarn**

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd energy-dashboard
Set Up and Run the Backend:

bash
Copy
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install flask flask-cors pandas
python app.py
The backend will run on port 5000.
Open your browser and navigate to:
https://<your-codespace-name>-5000.preview.app.github.dev/api/data to view the JSON data.
Set Up and Run the Frontend:

bash
Copy
cd ../frontend/energy-dashboard-frontend
yarn install
yarn start
The React app should open in your browser (usually at http://localhost:3000 or via Codespaces preview).
The Dashboard component will fetch data from the backend and display it in a chart.
Using Docker
If you prefer running everything in containers, use Docker Compose:

Build and Run with Docker Compose:

From the project root:

bash
Copy
docker-compose up --build
Access the Services:

Backend: http://localhost:5000/api/data
Frontend: http://localhost:3000
Docker & Corporate-Scale Overview
In large organizations, containerization and orchestration are standard practices:

Containerization with Docker:
Each service is packaged in its own Docker container, ensuring consistency across environments.
Docker Compose:
Simplifies multi-container application setup for development and testing.
CI/CD and Orchestration:
Corporate environments use CI/CD pipelines and platforms like Kubernetes for deployment, ensuring automated testing and scalable deployments.
Git Commands Overview
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy
git clone <repository-url>
Check repository status:
bash
Copy
git status
Stage changes:
bash
Copy
git add .
Commit changes:
bash
Copy
git commit -m "Your commit message"
Push changes to remote:
bash
Copy
git push
Pull changes from remote:
bash
Copy
git pull
Deployment
Backend Deployment:
Deploy the Flask backend to Fly.io using Docker (free tier).
Once deployed, your backend will have a valid SSL certificate and can be accessed via a URL like: https://energy-dashboard-backend.fly.dev/api/data
Frontend Deployment:
Deploy the React frontend to Vercel by importing your GitHub repository and setting the root directory to frontend/energy-dashboard-frontend.
